## Tar Heel Dev Studio

This is the official website for Tar Heel Dev Studio. I had to create a second version after my first website - let's just say, stopped existing. I won't get into details about what happened, but I just need a new website now!

I figured it be best to start from scratch with Next.js and get something deployed for now. 

## Getting Started

Started with the starting files on PyCharm. To get started, do the good ol:

```nextjs
cd tarheeldigital
npm run dev
```

Then watch on http://host:3000/ as I make changes. 

## More About This Site
